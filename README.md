# Real-time Audio Processing: Swahili Speech Analysis

This project implements a comprehensive audio processing pipeline using the Mozilla Common Voice Swahili dataset, following the CRISP-DM methodology. We'll cover speech-to-text conversion, sentiment analysis, and text summarization with state-of-the-art models.

## 2. Business Understanding

### Problem Definition

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive audio processing system for Swahili speech with three main objectives:

1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Accurately transcribe Swahili speech to text
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the emotional content of transcribed speech
3. **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of transcribed content

### Real-world Applications

- **Education**: Supporting language learning and assessment
- **Business Intelligence**: Analyzing customer feedback in Swahili-speaking regions
- **Media Monitoring**: Processing Swahili broadcast content
- **Healthcare**: Facilitating medical consultations in Swahili-speaking communities
- **Government Services**: Improving accessibility of public services

## 4. Data Preparation

### 4.1 Audio Preprocessing Functions

We'll define several functions to preprocess our audio data.

### 4.2 Visualize Audio Processing Results

### 4.3 Prepare Dataset for Training

Now we'll create a function to process our entire dataset.

## 5. Modeling

In this section, we'll implement three main components:
1. Speech-to-Text using Whisper
2. Sentiment Analysis using DistilBERT
3. Text Summarization using T5

<a id='6'></a>
## 6. Evaluation

Let's evaluate our models' performance using appropriate metrics for each task.

<a id='7'></a>
## 7. Deployment

Let's create a Streamlit web interface for real-time audio processing. This interface will allow users to:
1. Upload audio files
2. Record audio directly
3. View processing results in real-time
4. Provide feedback for model improvement

To run the Streamlit app, save this notebook and execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
